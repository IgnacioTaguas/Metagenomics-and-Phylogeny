#Reads mapping

#Script that indexes a genome and then alignes any number of FASTA files with it, and gets some characteristics of the alignment.
#It generates: 
###A directory for the indexed genome
###A directory for the SAM files generated, a file with statistics created while doing the alignment and another file with the same statistics obtained from the SAM alignment.

#This script takes as arguments:
###The reference genome
###The name of the output for the indexed genome
###Any number of triples of arguments: 
#####The FASTA file to align
#####The desired name for the SAM file generated
#####The desired name for the stats file generated (the other stats file will have the same name with the prefix "command_"
