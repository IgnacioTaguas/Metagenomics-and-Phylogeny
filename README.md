# Metagenomics-project
In-depth genomic exploration of the ecosystem of a hot spring located in Iceland, in which episodes of high temperature (close to 90ยบ) occur coinciding with regular activities in a nearby volcano.



This directory also has a PDF (Phylogeny) written in spanish with a detailed pipeline of a different project, related with the subject, consisting on the phylogenetic analysis of viral genomes comparing the maximum likelihood and bayesian estimation methods. The programs used were:
  - MEGA: to assess genetic distances.
  - jModelTest, PhyML and FigTree: to compute a phylogenetic tree using maximum likelihood.
  - BEAUti2, BEAST2, Tracer, TreeAnnotator: to compute a phylogenetic tree using bayesian statistic.
  - FigTree: to plot the phylogenetic trees.
